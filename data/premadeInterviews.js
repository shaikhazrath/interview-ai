                question: "Explain the concept of garbage collection in Java. How does the G1 (Garbage First) collector work?",
                feedbackAnswer: "Candidates should explain that garbage collection is the automatic memory management process in Java. They should mention that it identifies and deletes objects that are no longer needed. For G1, key points include: it's designed for multi-processor machines with large memories, it divides the heap into regions, it's both a generational and incremental collector, and it aims to provide high throughput with minimal pauses. Understanding of concurrent marking and the evacuation pause concept would be impressive."

                question: "Describe the Java Memory Model and its importance in concurrent programming.",
                feedbackAnswer: "A good answer should cover that the Java Memory Model (JMM) specifies how the Java virtual machine works with the computer's memory. Key points include: it defines how and when different threads can see values written to shared variables by other threads, and how to synchronize access to shared variables. The candidate should mention concepts like happens-before relationship, volatile keyword, and memory barriers. They should explain its importance in writing correct concurrent programs and avoiding issues like race conditions and memory visibility problems."

            {
                question: "How does Java's CompletableFuture work? How does it improve upon the regular Future interface?",
                feedbackAnswer: "Candidates should explain that CompletableFuture is a class introduced in Java 8 for asynchronous programming. They should mention it implements Future and CompletionStage interfaces. Key improvements over regular Future include: ability to chain multiple asynchronous computations, combine multiple futures, handle errors asynchronously, and manually complete the future. They should be able to give examples of methods like thenApply(), thenCompose(), thenCombine(), and exceptionally(). Understanding of how it works with Java's Fork/Join framework would be a plus."

            {
                question: "Explain the concept of database indexing. How does it improve query performance, and what are potential drawbacks?",
                feedbackAnswer: "A strong answer should explain that an index is a data structure that improves the speed of data retrieval operations on a database table. Candidates should mention that indexes can be created using one or more columns, providing a quick lookup table for row locations. They should explain that indexing improves query performance by reducing the number of disk I/O operations required. However, they should also mention drawbacks: indexes require additional storage space, they can slow down insert/update/delete operations, and they need to be carefully chosen based on query patterns. Knowledge of different types of indexes (e.g., B-tree, hash) and when to use them would be impressive."
            },
            {
                question: "Describe the CAP theorem and its implications for distributed database systems.",
                feedbackAnswer: "Candidates should explain that the CAP theorem states that a distributed system can only provide two of three guarantees simultaneously: Consistency (all nodes see the same data at the same time), Availability (every request receives a response), and Partition tolerance (the system continues to operate despite network failures). They should discuss the trade-offs involved in choosing between CA, CP, and AP systems, and give examples of each. A good answer would also touch on how modern distributed systems often have to make practical compromises between these properties, and how techniques like eventual consistency try to balance these concerns."
            },
            {
                question: "Explain the concept of dynamic programming and provide an example of how you might use it to solve a complex problem.",
                feedbackAnswer: "Candidates should define dynamic programming as a method for solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems. They should mention it's applicable when problems have overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure. A good explanation would include the concept of memoization or tabulation to store solutions to subproblems. For an example, they might describe solving the longest common subsequence problem, the knapsack problem, or finding the shortest path in a graph. Look for clear explanation of how they would define the subproblems, the recurrence relation, and how they would build up the solution."
            },
            {
                question: "Describe a situation where you had to make a difficult decision with incomplete information. How did you approach it?",
                feedbackAnswer: "Look for candidates who can demonstrate analytical thinking, risk assessment, and decision-making skills. A good answer should describe the situation, the stakes involved, what information was missing, and how they went about gathering what information they could. They should explain their decision-making process, including any frameworks or methodologies they used. Ideally, they should also mention how they communicated their decision to stakeholders and any lessons learned from the outcome. This question helps assess how candidates might handle the ambiguity often present in complex technical projects."
            },
            {
                question: "At Google, we value innovation and continuous learning. Can you give an example of how you've demonstrated these qualities in your work or personal projects?",
                feedbackAnswer: "Strong answers will showcase the candidate's passion for technology and ability to take initiative. Look for examples of self-directed learning, experimentation with new technologies, or innovative solutions to problems. This could include contributions to open-source projects, personal coding projects, or instances of introducing new technologies or methodologies in their workplace. The candidate should be able to articulate what they learned from these experiences and how they've applied that knowledge. This question helps assess cultural fit and the candidate's alignment with Google's values of innovation and continuous improvement."
